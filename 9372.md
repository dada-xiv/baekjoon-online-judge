spanning tree is a graph defined as follows:

1. It must contain all vertices.
2. It is a graph in which vertices are connected to each other, and there are no cycles (the fundamental property of a tree).

A spanning tree is one that includes all vertices, and every vertex is connected by at least one edge. Furthermore, it should not form any cycles in the connection relationships. Therefore, when a spanning tree has n vertices, it will have n-1 edges.
